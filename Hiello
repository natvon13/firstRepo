Once upon a time, there lived a pencile. This pencile was created in a factory and has spent the last few months in storage, ready to be shipped away. The pencile was very nervous about where it would be shipped. Where would I spend the rest of it's life? Who would use it to write? What would this person be writing? Pencils are very special in that they are able to gain knowladge about whatever it is they are being used to write for. If this pencile is used for solving math problems, this pencile will learn to do math. If this pencile is used to write about books, it will learn about those books. 

This pencile was also thinking about what other pencils it will be spending time with. Will these pencils be similar to it, or will they be mechanical? What will they have learned about?
